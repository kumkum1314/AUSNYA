Naturally, Manali, with its well-worn paths, bustling markets, and catalog of Instagrammable spots, becomes the go-to destination. But while Manali yawns under the weight of its own popularity, a quieter, greener, and infinitely more soulful alternative awaits just a few hours away \u2014 Tirthan Valley.<\/p><p>Nestled in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh, Tirthan Valley remains a hidden gem, untouched by the chaos of mainstream tourism. If you\u2019re wondering where to travel in May that offers both serenity and soul, Tirthan is where your heart will find peace. Here&#8217;s why this lesser-known haven is quickly emerging as the best place in Himachal to visit in May, and why it\u2019s stealing the spotlight from Manali \u2014 one traveler at a time.<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The Gift of Stillness in a Noisy World<\/li><\/ol><p>Manali in May is a visual paradox. Snow-capped peaks still glisten in the distance, but closer to town, traffic jams clog the roads and selfie sticks dominate the landscape. There\u2019s a palpable rush \u2014 to see, to do, to consume. Tirthan Valley, on the other hand, invites you to slow down. There\u2019s no honking. No touts chasing you. Just the river\u2019s hum, birdsong, and whispering pines.<\/p><p>In a world that\u2019s constantly asking us to \u201churry up,\u201d Tirthan is your permission to pause.<\/p><ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A River Runs Through It<\/li><\/ol><p>The valley gets its name from the Tirthan River, a glacial stream that runs crystal-clear all year round. In May, as snow melts and flowers bloom, the river is at its poetic best \u2014 fast-flowing yet soothing, cold yet inviting. Unlike the crowded Beas in Manali, the Tirthan gives you space. You can dip your feet in, trek along its edge, or simply lie on a riverside boulder and watch time float by.<\/p><p>Adventure seekers, too, find a friend in the Tirthan. Trout fishing here is not just a hobby, it&#8217;s a ritual. And the best part? It\u2019s strictly regulated to protect the ecosystem, a refreshing contrast to the over-commercialization seen elsewhere.<\/p><ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Gateway to the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP)<\/li><\/ol><p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Great Himalayan National Park is a short drive and trek from the heart of Tirthan. In May, the trails burst into color \u2014 rhododendrons, wild orchids, and medicinal herbs create a visual symphony that no camera can do justice to. With over 375 species of fauna including the elusive snow leopard and the Himalayan tahr, this forest is not just a biodiversity hotspot, but a spiritual experience.<\/p><p>Unlike Solang Valley or Rohtang Pass, where tourism often overwhelms nature, GHNP offers a relationship \u2014 between traveler and terrain, birdwatcher and bird, soul and silence.<\/p><ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Locals Who Welcome, Not Sell<\/li><\/ol><p>In Manali, you\u2019re often seen as a customer. In Tirthan, you\u2019re seen as a guest.<\/p><p>The villagers of Tirthan Valley, whether in Gushaini, Nagini, or Banjar, embody a warmth that can\u2019t be faked. Whether it\u2019s sharing stories over a cup of chai or guiding you through a hidden waterfall trail, hospitality here is genuine, rooted in generations of living with the land.<\/p><p>And it reflects in the accommodations too. Most stays in Tirthan are cozy homestays and eco-resorts that blend into the landscape, unlike the concrete hotels sprouting in Manali. Places like Raju\u2019s Cottage have become legendary not just for their location, but for their soulful service.<\/p><ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Treks That Heal, Not Exhaust<\/li><\/ol><p>Sure, you can trek in Manali. But you\u2019ll often be in a crowd \u2014 loud music, trash-strewn trails, and Insta-staged moments included. Tirthan offers trekking with meaning. The Serolsar Lake trail from Jalori Pass, the hike to the waterfall from Gushaini, or the paths through Rolla inside GHNP \u2014 these aren\u2019t just fitness goals, they\u2019re meditative experiences.<\/p><p>And May is perfect for it. The weather is cool, the skies are clear, and the forests are alive. You won\u2019t need oxygen cylinders or snow gear. Just a good pair of shoes and a heart ready to be touched.<\/p><ol start=\"6\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Eco-conscious Travel<\/li><\/ol><p>One of the most compelling reasons why Tirthan is emerging as a Manali alternative is its conscious resistance to mass tourism. There are no mega-hotel chains here. The local community, aware of the mistakes made in places like Manali and Shimla, has taken steps to protect its fragile ecology.<\/p><p>The Himachal Pradesh High Court\u2019s ruling in 2023 to protect Tirthan as a free-flowing river \u2014 banning all hydropower and dam projects \u2014 is a testament to this resolve. For travelers looking to reduce their carbon footprint and support sustainable travel, Tirthan isn\u2019t just a destination, it\u2019s a movement.<\/p><ol start=\"7\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A May Full of Magic<\/li><\/ol><p>What makes Tirthan Valley one of the best places to visit in Himachal in May isn\u2019t just the weather (though it\u2019s perfect), or the flowers (though they\u2019re plenty). It\u2019s the feeling the valley gives you. That you\u2019ve arrived not just somewhere special, but somewhere sacred.<\/p><p>No wonder it\u2019s quietly becoming the darling of conscious travelers \u2014 those who want depth over dazzle, immersion over itineraries.<\/p><ol start=\"8\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Perfect for All Kinds of Travelers<\/li><\/ol><p>Whether you\u2019re a couple looking for a romantic escape, a family seeking quiet bonding time, a solo traveler on a digital detox, or a group of friends wanting to reconnect with nature \u2014 Tirthan has something for everyone. And unlike Manali, it doesn&#8217;t come with the strain of crowds, overpriced cafes, or traffic snarls.<\/p><p>If you&#8217;re asking, &#8220;where should I travel in May to truly unwind?&#8221; \u2014 this is your sign.<\/p><ol start=\"9\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Tips for Traveling to Tirthan in May<\/li><\/ol><p>How to reach: From Delhi, take a Volvo to Aut (near Kullu) and then a cab to Tirthan (Gushaini or Nagini). You can also drive directly.<br>Stay options: Book in advance, as most good eco-stays and boutique properties fill up quickly in May.<br>Connectivity: Most places have limited mobile network. And that\u2019s a gift, not a glitch.<br>Pack smart: Light woolens, sunscreen, trekking shoes, and a good book.<br>Respect local culture: Don\u2019t litter, don\u2019t play loud music, and always ask before photographing locals.<br>Final Word<\/p><p>Manali will always be on the tourist map \u2014 it&#8217;s convenient, commercial, and well-connected. But for those who crave authenticity over agenda, nature over nightlife, and presence over popularity, Tirthan Valley is the whisper you\u2019ve been waiting to hear.<\/p><p>This May, travel beyond the obvious. Let Manali be for the masses. Let Tirthan be for the mindful.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[1:59 pm, 25\/4\/2025] Supriya Shinde: Like many urban escapists, our plan was simple: pack light, head to the hills, and breathe again.
